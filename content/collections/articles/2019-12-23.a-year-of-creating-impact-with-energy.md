<p>Exactly one year ago, STELLA Futura started its journey in Sub-Saharan Africa, creating a subsidiary in Ghana, for future local growth of clean, safe and affordable energy solutions.</p><p>We, that created STELLA, had one large goal: Achieving impact on all global development goals set by the UN (SDG’s) within the next 24 months.</p><p>We shouldn’t be just another energy engineering company. Rather, we are the impact energy company. Closing in on the Holidays, our Christmas gift to our loved ones is one year of hard work on our way reaching impact on all global development goals.</p><p>Below are some of the highlights from this year that we want to share with you:</p><p><strong>Q1 2019</strong></p><p>STELLA establishes a local head office in Accra, Ghana and employs our first local team member, Nickie Johnson, as Head of Business development. Nickie is our first young African women leader in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>STELLA is chosen as energy solution partner by CHAG (Christian Health Association of Ghana) to develop energy solutions for a pipeline of 95 hospitals within the administration. A pilot is planned to be executed during 2019.</p><p>STELLA becomes the system technology provider of Tesvolt battery systems, to be the Tesvolt design and installation partner in Ghana.</p>
